decido
======

The goal of decido is to provide an R binding to the Mapbox library [earcut.hpp](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp) for constrained polygon triangulation.

Ear cutting (or ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively 'cutting' triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are supported by introducing a bridge segment between polygon paths. The earcut library works with single-island-with-holes form polygons, analogous to the POLYGON type in simple features.

This augments the Javascript version available in [rearcut](https://github.com/hypertidy/rearcut.git) (also an R wrapper of the JS version by Mapbox). No comparison or testing has yet been done to compare these implementations.

In comparison to path-based ear-clipping, other libraries 'Triangle' and 'CGAL' provide edge-based *mostly Delaunay* triangulation. The Triangle library is available in the R package [RTriangle](https://CRAN.r-project.org/package=RTriangle). Experimental implementations binding CGAL are in [rcgal](https://github.com/s-u/rcgal) and [laridae](https://github.com/hypertidy/laridae).

Installation
------------

You can install decido from with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hypertidy/decido")
```

Development
-----------

Immediate needs:

-   clean up ability to specify holes
-   wrap around complex types of multiple polygons, etc.
-   tests!

See [rearcut](https://github.com/hypertidy/rearcut.git) for some approaches to the hole encoding. It's not hard, just rife with options. At the moment it seems best to stick close to how the JS earcut encodes them, and this translates very simply in C++.

Example
-------

This is a basic example of triangulating a single-ring polygon. The output is a vector of triplet indices defining each triangle.

``` r
library(decido)
x <- c(0, 0, 0.75, 1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.69)
y <- c(0, 1, 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0)
earcut(x, y)
#>  [1] 1 0 6 6 5 4 4 3 2 1 6 4 4 2 1


plot(x, y)
polygon(x, y, lwd = 10)
apply(matrix(earcut(x, y), nrow = 3), 2, function(ind) polygon(cbind(x, y)[ind + 1, ], col = "firebrick"))
```

Support for holes is provided by two required arguments `numholes` and `holes`. The holes are the starting index of each hole, here in C++ 0-based convention.

``` r
## hole starts at 9
x <- c(0, 0, 0.75, 1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.69, 0, 0.2,
      0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2)
y <- c(0, 1, 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0, 0, 0.2,
      0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2)
ind <- earcut(x, y, holes = 8, numholes = 1)
plot(x, y, asp = 1)

xy <- cbind(x, y)
apply(matrix(ind, 3), 2, function(i) polygon(xy[i + 1, ]))
```

    #> NULL

``` r
library(oz)
oz_ring <- oz::ozRegion(states = FALSE)
ring <- oz_ring$lines[[6]]
plot(ring, pch = ".", asp = 1/cos(42 * pi/180))
indices <- earcut(ring$x, ring$y)
xy <- cbind(ring$x, ring$y)
apply(matrix(indices, nrow = 3), 2, function(ind) polygon(xy[ind + 1, ]))
```

    #> NULL

Performance
-----------

Compare timing of C++ versus JS implementations.

``` r
 rbenchmark::benchmark(rearcut::earcut(cbind(ring$x, ring$y)), decido::earcut(ring$x, ring$y))
                                    test replications elapsed relative
#2     decido::earcut(ring$x, ring$y)          100   0.064    1.000
#1 rearcut::earcut(cbind(ring$x, ring$y))          100   4.147   64.797
```

Beware!
-------

This is in active development and the functions will change.

No checking is done on input coordinates, so use at your own risk!
