\title{decido: Bindings for 'Mapbox' Ear Cutting Triangulation Library}
\description{
Provides constrained triangulation of polygons. Ear cutting (or
ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively 'cutting'
triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are supported by introducing
a bridge segment between polygon paths. This package wraps the 'header-only'
library 'earcut.hpp' <https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.git>.
