Title: Bindings for 'Mapbox' Ear Cutting Triangulation Library 
Description: Provides constrained triangulation of polygons. Ear cutting (or 
 ear clipping) applies constrained triangulation by successively 'cutting'
 triangles from a polygon defined by path/s. Holes are supported by introducing
 a bridge segment between polygon paths. This package wraps the 'header-only' 
 library 'earcut.hpp' <https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.git>.
